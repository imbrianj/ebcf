      We try to keep our memberships simple. We charge month to month, with no long term commitments required.
      You can cancel at anytime directly through MindBody or by contacting us at info@elliottbaycrossfit.com.
      If you find yourself traveling frequently or otherwise occupied, and you need to suspend your membership for a
      time – just let us know and we’d be happy to take care of it for you or you may want to consider our Punch Card
      options. Finally, we provide a 10% discount to members of the same family and to LEO/Mil/Fire personnel.
