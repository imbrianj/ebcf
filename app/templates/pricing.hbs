      We try to keep our memberships simple. We charge month to month, with no long-term commitments required.
      You can cancel at anytime directly through Front Desk or by contacting us at info@elliottbaycrossfit.com.
      If you find yourself traveling frequently or otherwise occupied, and you need to suspend your membership for a time, just let us know and we’d be happy to take care of it for you.
      You may also want to consider our Punch Card option.
      Finally, we provide a 10% discount to members of the same family and to LEO/Mil/Fire personnel.
