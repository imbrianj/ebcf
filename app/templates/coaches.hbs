        I used to be one of the fat asthmatic kids, with a flabby gut below a nice pair of man boobs.
        In 6th grade, I tried out for the Math Relay team (I’m an engineer outside of CrossFit, math is my thing) and was cut for being too slow.
        It was quite pathetic. Finally, midway through high school, after years of torment (mostly from my brother), I decided to take a look at fitness and make some serious changes.
        I’ve never looked back since and now always look for ways to push my limits.
      </p>

        While living in CA in 2008, a buddy from my football team brought me to his gym.
        Here they focused solely on functional movement, but were primarily strength based.
        Regardless, I was hooked and began seeing changes/improvements I hadn’t known before.
        When I moved back to WA I tried to find something similar and settled with a local powerlifting gym; I even competed.
        I enjoyed it, but yearned for something more multi-dimensional.
        Luckily I came across YouTube highlights of the ’09 CrossFit Games.
        I couldn’t stop watching. Not only could these guys powerlift, they had athletic ability in so many other facets.
        Like real life ninja training. I had to get a piece. That’s when I walked into my local box and did Karen day 1.
        I felt like I was going to die. I couldn’t wait for day 2…
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, CrossFit has evolved into much more than my daily workout.
        It’s part of who I am and the lifestyle I choose to live.
        It’s opened so many doors and introduced me to so many new friends.
        I can easily say, while the fitness aspects are amazing, the community it has created for me is the number one benefit and one I hope to pass along at Elliott Bay CrossFit.

        I found CrossFit in 2013 after my parents had been doing it for about a year and convinced me to give it a try.
        I loved the competitive edge and sense of community that CrossFit offered, and I LOVED getting strong!
        I started to get more involved in Olympic Weightlifting and joined Venice Barbell Club in 2015, where I solely focused on lifting, and trained to be competitive in the sport.
        Now, I'm certified as a USAW Sports Performance Coach under Jim Schmitz, a long-time USAW and Olympic level coach.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently relocated to Seattle and found that great sense of community at EBCF.
        I am passionate about sharing my knowledge of Olympic Lifting with anyone looking to get stronger and more powerful.
        I am excited to bring a dedicated weightlifting program to EBCF!

        I have been an athlete my whole life.
        I was a state placer for the Washington State Wrestling tournament, competitive power lifter, and competed in physique bodybuilding.
        My love for fitness easily drove me to my career in personal training.
        My passion is helping other people reach their fitness goals and change lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being the "bro" that I am, I avoided Crossfit at all costs.
        However I started dabbling in some Olympic lifting and Crossfit inevitably followed.
        It wasn't until I started at Elliott Bay CrossFit that I fell in love with the sport.
        The competitive, tight knit, family nature of the box showed me what CrossFit was all about.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people and friends I have met here are truly amazing.
        I am excited to share my knowledge and continue to learn with this amazing community.

        I’m just a small town kid who loves a good workout, making new friends, and challenging myself and others to do better.
        What better way to do that than CrossFit?
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always loved learning and playing new sports.
        While in high school, I played and lettered in football, basketball, baseball, track and cross-country.
        I had a couple of offers to run cross-country and track in college.
        Ultimately, I decided to go to college on a academic scholarship.
        I still wanted to stay active and in shape, so I played a lot of intramural sports throughout college.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day one of my roommates, Jake, showed me the CrossFit.com website.
        We would read the WOD description, watch videos, and go attempt it at our recreational center.
        Most of the times we would have to modify the WOD to make due with the equipment at the rec; we even had to make our own rings and medicine ball!
        This was back when CrossFit was still at it’s grassroots. It was not what it is today, but it was still so amazing.
        We often got crazy looks, but we didn’t care.
        It’s been amazing to see how it has transformed and changed the lives of so many people!
      </p>

      <p>
        When I graduated college, my job had me out in California for about a year.
        This was amazing as I had the opportunity and privilege to become a part of different gyms and communicates in Northern California including Crossfit CSA, Crossfit Santa Cruz Central, and Humboldt Crossfit.
        When I moved back to Minneapolis, I joined Crossfit Minneapolis and then joined Crossfit Nordeast as a part-time coach.
        I have been able to learn so much from these amazing communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that I’m in the PNW, I’m excited to be a part of Elliott Bay and share my knowledge, coach, and challenge members to strive for their best!

      <p>
        My initial CrossFit story is pretty typical:  I was a long time athlete playing baseball in college, but got lazy after graduation.
        A buddy introduced me to a new way of working out and I got totally hooked.
        I love the gym community and the friendly competition that it inspires; the new, challenging movements that I continue to learn and perfect; and the way that I look and feel – I am in my best shape ever.
        However, outside of the awesome family of gym members that keep me coming back (in my experience, EBCF is second to none in this regard), I could not have found most of that in any other workout regimen.
      </p>

      <p>
        What sets this apart is the focus on being functional.
        I was always “banged up” when I was an athlete.
        Our trainers joked that I spent more time in the rehab room than they did with back, knee, neck, elbow, and hamstring issues.
        I always gritted my way through it in order to keep competing, getting patched up with ice, stim, ultrasound, and even a couple cortisone shots, but I was never fixed.
        I was still strong and successful, but it’s hard to enjoy yourself when you are in pain almost all of the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        After taking up CrossFit, it was quickly apparent that I had a lot to learn about the right way to move.
        I learned better posture, how to correctly use my core, mobility exercises to improve my flexibility and range of motion, and countless other tips and tricks.
        It took time and I am still a work in progress, but I was shocked at how much I improved.
        The nagging issues finally started going away and I was much stronger for it.
        CrossFit is the first athletic pursuit that I have experienced that builds me up instead of breaking me down, and I am super jazzed to pass on some of this hard-earned knowledge.

        In 2006, I was working out at an LA fitness and just going through the motions of being a body builder when a buddy told me to try this workout he saw on the Internet.
        That humbling workout led me back to CrossFit.com and the rest is history.
        CrossFit gave me an outlet for my competitive drive that I had been missing since I left high school sports.
        After all these years doing CrossFit I realize that it has given me so much more than just fitness — it has given me a community and some great friends.
        The CrossFit community allows me to workout and truly care about the person working out next to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        These past 7 years, I have learned a great deal through hands-on experience and the advice of some truly amazing mentors.
        I truly want everyone who comes to our gym to walk away fitter and more knowledgeable about movement.
        This is my passion and I try and share that passion through my instruction.

        I've been active my whole life--fitness, sport, athletics--whatever you call it it's been a passion of mine.
        I ran D1 track and field at the University of Northern Colorado where I specialized in hurdles, jumps, and sprints.
        During my last year I also was the assistant strength and conditioning coach overseeing many sports.
        After college I avoided CrossFit for quite awhile allowing negative influences to affect my pursuit.
        Nevertheless in my search to stay active after college athletics I finally had to give it a try.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2012 I started at CrossFit Roseville. Instantly I fell in love with the community and the sport!
        So much so that my husband Kenny and I became owners and coaches of CrossFit Roseville in 2014.
        Though we have been relocated to Seattle I have years of experience coaching the ins and outs of CrossFit.
        For myself, I quickly found I became a more well-rounded athlete and my life was being positively effected from my CF time.
        I loved challenging my athleticism and building community! I coach to bring this same challenge, joy, and reward to others lives.

        Born and raised in the great pacific northwest.
        Sports have always been a big part of my life growing up.
        After playing soccer in college, I was in search of that competitive edge I was always chasing and one day in 2013 I found it with CrossFit.
        My journey started when my neighbor across the street had a garage gym and asked if I wanted to do a WOD.
        As confused as I was I gave it a shot and was hooked ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that I have been doing CrossFit for a few years the gym has always been my happy place.
        A place where I feel at home and know I can always have fun. Since then I’ve realized sharing that passion by helping others achieve their goals keeps my drive growing even faster.
        Additionally the community I’ve found within CrossFit has provided me with many of my closest friends and many who I look up to and help me become not only a better athlete, but a better person.
        Becoming a bigger part of and extending that community as a coach gives me some of my greatest sense of achievement and I’m excited to see where the journey takes me.
